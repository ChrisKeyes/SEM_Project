Cathy,
Below is a set of notes that I wanted to pass along for the SEM_Project:

1. The book I would recommend: "Analysis of Questionnaire Data with R", Bruno Falissard 2012

2. The outliers for CUVA were identified using the 2 rules outlined in Stynes & White, "Reflections on Measuring Recreation and Travel Spending" 2006
I also dropped obs. where campIn was > 10 as cuva sets a 10 day limit for camping.  
Observations where totalCovered was > 3 standard deviations above mean were also dropped.  This is more conservative than stynes, who would drop any 
totalCovered > 7 due to expenditure recall issues.

3. The check segments_1 identifies observations where there are two or more accomodations with the same number of 
nights entered.  These observations are assigned one of the matching segments, but it is basically random.  The user
needs to correct these manually.  The script genSEGMENTS.R will notify the user of the ID's.
